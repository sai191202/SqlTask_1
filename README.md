# Sql Task 1

# DESCRIPTION
COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS NAME: PELLURU SAI INTERN ID:CT12VCC DOMAIN: SQL DURATION: 8 WEEKS MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

Editor Platform:MySql Relatinal Database Management Sysetm (RDBMS).

The SQL script provided demonstrates various JOIN operationsâ€”INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOINâ€”which are used to combine data from two related tables: Employees and Departments. These joins help retrieve meaningful relationships between employees and their respective departments. The script first creates both tables and inserts sample data. The Employees table contains employee details, including a department ID (DeptID) referencing the Departments table, which stores department names. The JOIN queries allow us to extract relevant records based on matching DeptID values in both tables.

The main steps in the script include:

Creating Tables (Employees and Departments).
Inserting Data into these tables.
Performing Different JOIN Operations to combine data meaningfully.
The main blocks of the code are:

Table Creation Block: Defines the structure of the Employees and Departments tables.
Data Insertion Block: Populates tables with sample values.
Query Execution Block: Runs different JOIN queries to retrieve combined results.

Applicability of This SQL Code
This SQL script is highly useful in real-world applications such as HR databases, company management systems, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, where organizations need to analyze employee records and departmental information. It is particularly relevant in data analytics, reporting, and dashboard development, helping businesses extract insights from relational databases. Additionally, these concepts are crucial for SQL-based job interviews and database-related internships.

By executing this script, users gain a practical understanding of how JOIN operations help merge datasets efficiently and handle missing or unmatched records between tables. This is essential for anyone working with SQL in data science, software development, or cloud-based database management systems. ðŸš€
